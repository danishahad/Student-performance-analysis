# Student Performance Analysis 

This project explores the relationship between hours studied, sleep hours,question papers practiced and previous scores on student performance using Python and statistical visualization tools.

## Files Included
- **stats_project_final.ipynb** – Jupyter notebook with complete code
- **Student_Performance.csv** – Dataset used
- **pdf_format_stats_project.pdf** – Report with plots and insights

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- More study hours and higher previous scores generally 
   lead to better performance
- Sleep and sample papers show no clear linear trend 
    with performance
- Previous scores show the strongest linear relationship 
   with performance index
- Some outliers exist where students with high previous 
   scores underperformed
- The Central Limit Theorem holds for performance sampling.
